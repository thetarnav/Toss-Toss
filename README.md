## Game Rules:

Toss Toss is a 2-player game, the first one to reach the specified amount of points wins (normally 2000).

Both players take turns playing.

One's turn ends either by:
1.  *Passing the turn and keeping the erned round score.*
2.  *Getting a 'bust' by rolling and not having any scoring dice.*

Points are gained for every 1 or 5 thrown, and for three or more of a kind of any other number. Scoring is as follows:

-   _a single  **1**  is worth 100 points_
-   _a single  **5**  is worth 50 points_
-   _**three of a kind**  is worth 100 points multiplied by the given number, e.g. three 4s are worth 400 points_
-   _**three 1's**  are worth 1,000 points_
-   _**four or more of a kind**  is worth double the points of three of a kind, so four 4s are worth 800 points, five 4s are worth 1,600 points etc._
